Creating a full-fledged Student Information System (SIS) involves multiple components and functionalities. 
Below is a simplified example of a Student Information System implemented in Java. 
This example covers basic features such as managing student records, course registrations, grades, and generating transcripts.
This is a simple console-based implementation. 
In a real-world scenario, you might want to consider using a database to persist data, implementing a graphical user interface,
and adding more advanced features such as user authentication and authorization.
